"""Main API Routes Module - Modular Endpoint Integration.

This module serves as the central router that imports and integrates
all modularized endpoint modules.

All endpoint logic has been moved to dedicated modules:
- System endpoints: server/endpoints/system_endpoints.py
- Authentication: server/endpoints/auth_endpoints.py  
- AI/Query processing: server/endpoints/ai_endpoints.py
- Device management: server/endpoints/device_endpoints.py
- Data operations: server/endpoints/data_endpoints.py
- File management: server/endpoints/file_endpoints.py
- Webhooks: server/endpoints/webhook_endpoints.py
- Shared models: server/endpoints/models.py

# 📁 ai_endpoints.py        - AI query processing
# 📁 device_endpoints.py    - Device registration and management
# 📁 data_endpoints.py      - Data upload and analytics
# 📁 file_endpoints.py      - File upload and management
# 📁 webhook_endpoints.py   - Phone/Twilio webhooks (/phone/*)
# 📁 sensor_endpoints.py    - Sense HAT sensor management (/sensors/*)
# 📁 network_endpoints.py   - WiFi and network configuration (/network/*)
# 📁 training_endpoints.py  - ML training and federated learning (/training/*, /federated/*)
# 📁 curriculum_endpoints.py - Educational content and progress (/curriculum/*)
# 📁 models.py             - Shared request/response models
